title: Letter to Aspiring Developers

Dear Aspiring Developer...or coder...or programmer... or... whatever,

It's confusing enough to even know what difference there is, if any, between a coder, or developer or a programmer (I'll give you a hint, depending on who you talk to, you'll find out that there pretty much the same things). Here's another hint, you're going to have to be "okay" with there being lots of different names for the same thing. Not only that, you're going to have to be alright with there being an overwhelming number of different approaches and "what works for me" ways of doing things. I'm going to try and explain why I chose to take the path to being a developer in a very specific way: Omaha Code School.

It was only about 6 or 7 months ago that I began to even consider giving Omaha Code School a shot. Prior to this, I had absolutely no experience in web development, coding, or even web design. I'd always had a knack for finding my way around computers and figuring solutions and work arounds for bugs and other tech related problems as they'd arise. In fact, I can remember many people - and more than once - tell me that I should consider a job as a programmer or at least in the IT field. To be honest, though, I was always intimidated by such a prospect. I'll try to explain why below.

What always bothered me most about the idea of learning some specific programming language is the idea that there were so many languages out there. Which one should I start with? Is one language better than another? I remember walking in to places like Barnes & Noble and seeing books upon books on the shelves of the "programming languages" section. Even more, I remember the overwhelming feeling of defeat as I realized that so many of those books had to be updated repeatedly or face the threat of becoming obsolete. It was then that I told myself I'd never learn to code.

I changed my mind. Yes, there are tons of languages out there. And, yes, it is overwhelming if you think about it. On top of that, the languages and platforms out there are constantly changing and being updated or becoming obsolete. But at some point it recently occurred to me that this is the nature of just about everything in the modern world and that we can either resist it, or learn to embrace it. In fact, there are reasons to embrace this idea if you think about it. The fact that things are constantly changing levels the playing field in some sense. Also, it means those in the field need to stay sharp or face the risk of being surpassed by newbies. 

What finally persuaded me to "take the plunge" was the fact that I had decided to start "messing around" with JavaScript, HTML and CSS on websites like Codecademy with the intention of just seeing if it was something I would like in the first place. I blew right through those online classes (they are quite basic), but I absolutely loved learning to code. Then, just a few weeks after I had started learning on my own, I talked to a family friend who told me that another mutual friend of our had recently graduated from Omaha Code School and apparently had nothing but good things to say about it.

I am now just one week into class at Omaha Code School. I can already tell you that this was one of the best decisions I've made in my adult life. The first week has been very challenging and even trying at times. I've had to re-learn how to learn. I've spent more hours working on solutions to simple problems then I ever thought possible. I think it's important to emphasize what exactly you're getting at Omaha Code School that you won't really get online or from books: First off, you won't get Sumeet. 

Sumeet is the instructor and Omaha Code School and I couldn't ask for a better teacher. He is a gifted communicator with all of the qualities you want in an instructor. In addition to Sumeet, you also get a great community. The classes at Omaha Code School are small (around 20 students), and I can only speak for my own class, but I can tell you that having other students to work with in person is invaluable. Sumeet picked some very cool, friendly (and smart) students and working with them has a been a pleasure.

If you are considering joining Omaha Code School, I would encourage you to give it a shot. It doesn't matter how young or old you might think you are. With traditional education's growingly obvious shortcomings (not to mention the huge expense), I think that this approach to learning a skill has never been more viable or relevant. Give it a shot!
