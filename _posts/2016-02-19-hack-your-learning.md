title: Hack Your Learning
---

The word "hack" is being thrown around a lot these days, and seems to be used in reference to just about anything *but* computers. Today, we're going to talk about how I've learned to "hack" my learning. 

It's appropriate that I get to talk about learning - within the context of Omaha Code School - because I've already discovered so much about the way I learn in the last few weeks I've been here.

Now, I've always known that I need to get myself away from distractions when I work - this shouldn't be news to anyone - and I can't think of many people who *can* work well with distractions all around them. However, there's one thing I didn't realize would be an issue when it came to learning at code school, and that is the fact that I get distracted by worrying about where others are in their work and how my approach may be inferior to theirs. 

It took me about two weeks to realize this about myself. One day, I realized that my concern for where I stood in comparison with other students was actually getting the better of me and causing so much stress and anxiety that I needed to do something about it. 

So what did I do about it? Well, the nice thing about Omaha Code School is its progressive and flexible approach to learning. One of Sumeet's goals is to help students find what they need to put themselves in the best learning environment. This means that students are free to come and go throughout the day, once the lecture is finished, of course. So I started making the short (3 minute) drive to my favorite local coffee shop. 

Making this change has already proven to be the best "learning hack" I've made since starting at Omaha Code School. Being away from other students allows me to focus on my own work and not doubt my approach or worry about how far behind I may be (which is rarely the case, it turns out). You see, it's not that I don't work well with others. I absolutely do. Anyone can probably tell you that. It's also not that I dislike working with others. I definitely do! But so far, what we've done at Omaha Code School isn't "group work," per se. 

Other learning hacks that I've picked up over time are things like making sure I've always got my noise canceling headphones with me. They are huge help. What I listen to matters as well, it just matters on the time of day and what I'm feeling like. I've also found that taking breaks really helps, as well. It's important for me to get my blood flowing and to get outside and breathe some fresh air (which, unfortunately, is not always possible. Especially in Omaha where the summers are muggy and the winters are frigid).

The most important thing to come away with here is that *everyone* is different when it comes to learning. I'm sure anyone reading this can either add to my short list or even find that, perhaps, what helps them is opposite of what helps me. If learning is the goal, then finding whatever it takes to put yourself in a place where you can best learn should really be a top priority!
